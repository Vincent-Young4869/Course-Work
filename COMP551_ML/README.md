# ML projects in COMP551:

### NeurIPS Reproducibility Challenge (December 2019)

- In a team of 3, reproduced the result in the paper MelGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Conditional Waveform Synthesis. (raw audio files generation)
- Based on the techniques of machine learning and implemented in Python.

### CNN for Analysing Modified MNIST Dataset (November 2019)

- In a team of 3,  given a set of MNIST with each image containing 3 handwritten digits, and our task is to recognize the digit with the largest numerical value in each image.
- Based on the techniques of CNN deep learning (alexnet, vgg16, etc)and implemented in Python.

### Reddit Comments Classification (October 2019)

- In a team of 3,  given a set of text comments and our task is to classify them into 9 different topics.
- Using different machine learning models (naïve bayes, svm, knn…) and preprocessing techniques (lemmatization, tf*idf…).

### Implemeting LDA & logistic regression algorithm (November 2019)

- In a team of 3, implement LDA & LR from scratch.
- Evaluate the performance of each model on the Wine quality dataset.
